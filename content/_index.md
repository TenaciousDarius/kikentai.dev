## Introduction

Hello, my name's Darius and welcome to my personal blog! There ain't much here at the moment, and that's because I've just started building this up this evening.

I've been inspired by a talk given by a friend and colleague, Natalia Panferova, this weekend to start a blog. 

I have named my blog Ki Ken Tai. Ki Ken Tai Ichi is a concept in Kendo about the correct way to execute an attack.  

* Your spirit must be calm but focussed, set on your objective, and committed to the strike with nothing held back. 
* Sword can be literal, in the case of keiko in the dojo, or metaphorical in the case of skills and tools used to achieve an end. You must cut correctly and effectively. 
* Your body must commit with everything it has, and move swiftly to overcome your opponents ki and create the opportunity to strike.

 Spirit, sword and body must move as one. My new blog is in the spirit of this value, which I aspire to in my Kendo and elsewhere in life. So, it's settled. My website is called 

**Ki Ken Tai**

**Spirit Sword Body**

The blog will feature content related to Kendo, reflections and learnings as a Lead Software Engineer and whatever else I feel like. 

More content to follow. Stay tuned!
