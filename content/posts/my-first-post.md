## Introduction

Hello, my name's Darius and welcome to my personal blog! There ain't much here at the moment, and that's because I've just started building this up this evening. This is my first post.

I will be building this blog using Hugo and deploying using Netlify in order to learn these tools and give myself space to practice my software dev outside work.

Real artists ship, so this template will go out tonight, no matter how ugly it is. By doing this, I will confirm that my path to production is working as I expect and I can deploy changes to the site at whim.  

**Update - I've got CI/CD setup in Netlify to automatically build and deploy the site when I merge to main in github and need to test it, so here's an update :D
